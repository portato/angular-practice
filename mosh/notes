modules: a group of related components

//creating services
-logic to get data using http req can be added to components directly but w/issues:
    1. tight coupling - not good
    2. getting http req during unit testing of a component - not good
    3. may need to implement same logic in another component...
    4. component should only deal w/view
dependency injection creates a single instance of the class for the ENTIRE module so
beware using static dependencies

//binding
property binding can be tricky as there aren't always one-2-one binding of dom properties
to html attributes, in which case you use [attr.attribute_name]='field'
